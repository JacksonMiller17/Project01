##SUMMARY:##
############

Our sources cover some uses of artificial intelligence and deep learning in various fields: education, employment, career planning, spatial design, and clinical trial sourcing. AI is being used to help prevent students from failing by creating learning plans based on mined educational data where students succeeded the most. Its flexibility allows for the plans to be perfectly tailored to each student's learning capabilities. Further, when it comes time for those students to seek employment opportunities, AI assists in generating employment models for certain career fields to help students find where they should be focusing their job applications in order to be hired quickly. With the exponential rate of increasing demands in technology employment, employees are also using AI to create career development plans to further their employment opportunities, as well as improving themselves on a marketability level to find higher-paying jobs.

In other areas, China is using AI to work on spatial design for their buildings, such as museums. This is critical for a country like China, which often faces overcrowding and space issues in their cities, but others can use this technology simply to help use space as efficiently as possible, as it's a finite resource. Civil engineers will likely make heavy use of this tool when planning build projects. Lastly, in the medical field, clinical trial hosts are using AI to help find prospective volunteers based on previous applications to other trials, specifically in the oncology field. This is crucial, as making better medicine for cancer patients is vital to the overall battle against the disease, and this will help match patients to trials that will benefit both patient and research the most.
